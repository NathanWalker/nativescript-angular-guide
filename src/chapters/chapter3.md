## Application Logic

In this chapter you‚Äôll learn how to add JavaScript logic to your app, how to create services that talk to backend endpoints, and how to architect an app that uses multiple pages. There‚Äôs a lot to cover, so let‚Äôs start by discussing how to handle events and data binding.

### Events

Most user interfaces are driven by events. In NativeScript apps, those events are usually some user action, such as tapping, swiping, or rotating‚Äîand NativeScript abstracts the iOS- and Android-specific code for handling such events into a handful of easy-to-use APIs. Let‚Äôs start with the most common event you‚Äôll use in a NativeScript app: `tap`.

<h4 class="exercise-start">
    <b>Exercise</b>: Add a `tap` event handler
</h4>

Open `app/app.component.ts`, find the existing sign in button within your component‚Äôs `template` (`<Button text="Sign in"></Button>`), and replace it with the following code:

``` JavaScript
<Button text="Sign in" id="submit-button" (tap)="submit()"></Button>
```

Next, in the same file, replace the current `AppComponent` declaration with the one shown below:

``` JavaScript
export class AppComponent {
  submit() {
    console.log("hello");
  }
}
```

<div class="exercise-end"></div>

The `(eventName)="functionName()"` syntax is part of [Angular 2‚Äôs event binding system](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/template-syntax.html#!#event-binding), which lets you bind an event that occurs on a UI element to a function in your component‚Äôs class. In this case, the `(tap)="submit()"` syntax tells Angular to run the `AppComponent` class‚Äôs `submit()` function whenever the user taps the sign in button.

To verify this binding works tap the ‚ÄúSign In‚Äù button in your app; you should see ‚Äúhello‚Äù logged in your terminal or command prompt as such:

<img alt="Terminal showing the word hello logged" src="images/chapter3/terminal-1.png" class="plain">

> **TIP**:
> * In NativeScript you can find a list of events available in the appropriate UI element‚Äôs API documentation. For instance, the [button element‚Äôs API documentation](http://docs.nativescript.org/ApiReference/ui/button/Button) lists its `tap` event.
> * The Angular 2 docs have a helpful [cheat sheet](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/cheatsheet.html) that includes the various syntaxes available when building templates. Don‚Äôt worry too much about knowing how all these work at the moment; we‚Äôll progressively introduce the most common syntaxes in this guide.

With the `tap` event in place, you now have a way of tying the UI elements in your template to your TypeScript code. To make a login page actually work though, we need to introduce one other way of connecting a template to code: data binding.

### Data Binding

Angular 2 provides several ways to bind data in your TypeScript code to UI controls, and through the magic of NativeScript those same methods are available in your iOS and Android apps.

The first of these is a way to bind UI attributes to properties defined in your TypeScript class. Let‚Äôs look at how it works.

<h4 class="exercise-start">
    <b>Exercise</b>: Using Angular 2 attribute binding
</h4>

In `app/app.component.ts` replace the current `AppComponent` declaration with the one shown below, which adds a new `email` property, and changes the `submit()` method to display its value:

``` TypeScript
export class AppComponent {
  email = "user@nativescript.org";
  submit() {
    alert("You‚Äôre using: " + this.email);
  }
}
```

Next, find the first `<TextField>` in your component‚Äôs `template` and replace it with the code below, which adds a new `text` attribute:

``` XML
<TextField hint="Email Address" id="email" keyboardType="email" [text]="email"
  autocorrect="false" autocapitalizationType="none"></TextField>
```

<div class="exercise-end"></div>

The key thing to note here is the `[text]="email"` attribute on the `<TextField>`. This is Angular 2‚Äôs syntax for attribute binding, and it allows you to bind the value of an attribute to a property in your TypeScript class. In this case, the `text` attribute of the `<TextField>`‚Äîwhich is roughly equivalent to a DOM `<input>`‚Äôs `value` attribute‚Äîis bound to the `AppComponent`‚Äôs `email` attribute. Therefore the app now has an email address prefilled when it loads:

![Android with prefilled email](images/chapter3/android/1.png)
![iOS with prefilled email](images/chapter3/ios/1.png)

> **NOTE**: It‚Äôs very easy to confuse Angular 2‚Äôs event binding syntax `(eventName)="functionName()"` with its attribute binding syntax `[attributeName]="propertyName"` ü§î. Don‚Äôt worry though; if you get them backwards, the problem is usually easy to debug, as the functionality you‚Äôre attempting to add just won‚Äôt work. These syntaxes are common enough that you‚Äôll be using them a lot, and eventually you should be able to commit them to memory.

This attribute binding approach works really well when you need the data binding to be one way‚Äîthat is, when you need TypeScript properties, and changes to those properties done in TypeScript code, to appear in the user interface. But in the case of user interface controls that accept user input, such as the text field in this example, usually you need data binding to work two way‚Äîthat is, you additionally need changes the user makes to be reflected in your TypeScript code.

To show that the current example‚Äôs data binding is only one way, head back to your app, change the email text field‚Äôs value (type a few extra letters or something like that), and then tap the ‚ÄúSign In‚Äù button. Because your `submit()` function alerts the current value of your component‚Äôs `email` property‚Äî`alert("You‚Äôre using: " + this.email)`‚Äîyou might expect to see the updated value in the alert. Instead, however, you see the original value. Notice how the typed text and the alert value don‚Äôt match in the screenshot below.

![Android with email address that do not match](images/chapter3/android/2.png)

To fix this, you need to switch to Angular 2‚Äôs two-way data binding syntax.

<h4 class="exercise-start">
    <b>Exercise</b>: Two-way data binding with Angular 2
</h4>

In `app/app.component.ts`, find the find the first `<TextField>`, and replace it with the `<TextField>` below, which introduces a new `[(ngModel)]` attribute:

``` XML
<TextField hint="Email Address" id="email" keyboardType="email" [(ngModel)]="email"
  autocorrect="false" autocapitalizationType="none"></TextField>
```

<div class="exercise-end"></div>

At first glance the `[(ngModel)]` syntax looks more than a little odd, as it‚Äôs essentially a combination of the event and attribute binding syntax that you used in earlier examples. In the case of this example, `[(ngModel)]="email"` is shorthand for `[text]="email" (emailChange)="email=$event"`, which binds the email element‚Äôs `text` attribute to an `email` property and adds a `change` event handler that updates the `email` property‚Äôs value whenever the user makes a change.

Don‚Äôt worry too much about the details here while we‚Äôre still getting started. In your head you can think of `[(ngModel)]` as the way to implement two-way data binding when you need it on form controls. To show that it works, if you again modify your app‚Äôs email address and click the ‚ÄúSign In‚Äù button, you‚Äôll see the updated value in the alert as expected:

![Android with email addresses that do match](images/chapter3/android/3.png)

At this point, you have a basic login screen setup with two-way data binding‚Äînot bad for 20 some lines of code of TypeScript. (Think about how much code you‚Äôd have to write in Android Studio _and_ Xcode to accomplish the same task.) To this point though you‚Äôve been placing all of your logic in a single TypeScript file, which doesn‚Äôt scale all that well for real-world applications.

Before we tie this app to a backend and make this login screen fully functional, let‚Äôs take a step back and setup a structure that can scale.

<!--commenting this out as I don't think it belongs here. We just said we're going to move code out of the single file, then we start talking about more stuff to add to the single file...confuzzled-->

### Structuring your app

There are many reasons to segment any application into modular units, and you can [read about the various benefits on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_programming). Modularizing NativeScript apps, in addition, has one unique benefit: the ability to share the code you write between Angular-2-built web apps, and Angular-2-built native apps.

Even if you have no plans to create an Angular 2 web app, separating out your code is still advantageous for a number of other reasons‚Äîtestability, ease of maintenance, and so forth‚Äîbut if you _do_ have plans to build an Angular 2 web app, having a chunk of functionality that you can reuse in your native and web apps can be an invaluable time saver.

To see how this works in action, let‚Äôs edit some files in the `/shared` folder and set them up to be imported.

<h4 class="exercise-start">
    <b>Exercise</b>: Add a model object
</h4>

Let‚Äôs start by creating a simple model object to store user data. Open `app/user/user.ts` and paste in the following code:

``` JavaScript
export class User {
  email: string;
  password: string;
}
```

This code defines a simple [TypeScript class](http://www.typescriptlang.org/Handbook#classes) that does nothing more than define two properties‚Äî`email` and `password`. Note the use of [TypeScript‚Äôs `export` keyword](http://www.typescriptlang.org/Handbook#modules-going-external), as we‚Äôll see why that‚Äôs important momentarily.

Next, open `app/app.component.ts`, and first add the following `import` to the top of the file:

``` JavaScript
import {User} from "./shared/user/user";
```

Here you import the `User` class that you just defined. Note the parallel between the `export` command used in the previous example and the `import` command used here. The reason the `User` class is available to import is because it was explicitly exported. You‚Äôll see other examples of `import` and `export` as you go through this guide.

Next, replace the existing `AppComponent` definition with the one below, which uses the `User` class you just imported.

<!-- Todo, explain the isLoggingIn piece - from the exercise above I think. The button XML needs to be edited -->
``` JavaScript
export class AppComponent {
  user: User;
  isLoggingIn = true;

  constructor() {
    this.user = new User();
  }
  submit() {
    alert("You‚Äôre using: " + this.user.email);
  }
  toggleDisplay() {
    this.isLoggingIn = !this.isLoggingIn;
  }
}
```

Instead of storing data on the `AppComponent` directly, you‚Äôre now using the `User` model object, which is reusable outside of this page and even outside of this application. You instantiate an instance of the `User` class in a new `constructor` function, which Angular 2 invokes when it bootstraps your application.

Your final step is to use this new model object in your template. To do that, replace the two existing `<TextField>`s with the code shown below, which updates the `[(ngModel)]` bindings to point at the new `User` object:

``` XML
<TextField hint="Email Address" id="email" keyboardType="email" [(ngModel)]="user.email"
  autocorrect="false" autocapitalizationType="none"></TextField>
<TextField hint="Password" id="password" secure="true" [(ngModel)]="user.password"></TextField>
```

TODO: Better explanation. Move the full template into the login.html file and use `templateUrl`. 

If you got lost during this section, here‚Äôs a copy-and-paste friendly version of the full `app.component.ts` you should have at this point:

``` JavaScript
import {Component} from "angular2/core";
import {User} from "./shared/user/user";

@Component({
  selector: "my-app",
  templateUrl: "pages/login/login.html",
  styleUrls: ["pages/login/login-common.css", "pages/login/login.css"]
})
export class AppComponent {
  user: User;
  isLoggingIn = true;

  constructor() {
    this.user = new User();
  }
  submit() {
    alert("You‚Äôre using: " + this.user.email);
  }
  toggleDisplay() {
    this.isLoggingIn = !this.isLoggingIn;
  }
}

```

<div class="exercise-end"></div>

With this setup you now have a `User` class that you can share across pages in your app and even across applications. But a model object that‚Äôs four simple lines of code isn‚Äôt all that exciting. Where this approach really pays off is when you‚Äôre able to share your business logic, and the code that hits your backend systems. In Angular 2 those classes are known as services. Let‚Äôs look at them next.

### Services

A login screen isn‚Äôt all that useful if it doesn‚Äôt actually log users into anything. Therefore, our next task is to take the user‚Äôs email address and password, and send them to a backend endpoint to retrieve an authentication token we‚Äôll use later in this guide. We‚Äôll build this functionality as an Angular 2 service.

For the purposes of this tutorial we prebuilt a handful of backend endpoints using [Telerik Backend Services](http://www.telerik.com/platform/backend-services), and we‚Äôll be using those endpoints to make this app functional. Let‚Äôs see how they work.

> **NOTE**: You don't have to use Telerik Backend Services to power your app‚Äôs backend; you can use any HTTP API in a NativeScript app. Telerik Backend Services is convenient for us to use for this tutorial because it lets us spin up HTTP endpoints quickly.

<h4 class="exercise-start">
    <b>Exercise</b>: Add an Angular 2 service
</h4>

Open `app/shared/user/user.service.ts` and paste in the following code:

``` TypeScript
import {Injectable} from "angular2/core";
import {Http, Headers, Response} from "angular2/http";
import {User} from "./user";
import {Config} from "../config";
import {Observable} from "rxjs/Rx";
import "rxjs/add/operator/do";
import "rxjs/add/operator/map";

@Injectable()
export class UserService {
  constructor(private _http: Http) {}

  register(user: User) {
    var headers = new Headers();
    headers.append("Content-Type", "application/json");

    return this._http.post(
      Config.apiUrl + "Users",
      JSON.stringify({
        Username: user.email,
        Email: user.email,
        Password: user.password
      }),
      { headers: headers }
    )
    .catch(this.handleErrors);
  }

  handleErrors(error: Response) {
    console.log(JSON.stringify(error.json()));
    return Observable.throw(error);
  }
}
```

TODO: Explain that mess above, and probably break it into a lot of steps.

In `app.component.ts`, add the lines below to the top:

``` TypeScript
import {HTTP_PROVIDERS} from "angular2/http";
import {UserService} from "./shared/user/user.service";
```

Then change the constructor to this:

``` TypeScript
constructor(private _userService: UserService) {
  this.user = new User();
}
```

Add this line to the @Component:

``` TypeScript
providers: [UserService, HTTP_PROVIDERS],
```

Then change the submit function to this:

``` TypeScript
submit() {
  if (this.isLoggingIn) {
    this.login();
  } else {
    this.signUp();
  }
}
```

Then add these two functions:

``` TypeScript
login() {
  // TODO: Define
}
signUp() {
  this._userService.register(this.user)
    .subscribe(
      () => {
        alert("Your account was successfully created.");
        this.toggleDisplay();
      },
      () => alert("Unfortunately we were unable to create your account.")
    );
}
```

Create an account, then hardcode those credentials in your constructor to make testing easier:

``` TypeScript
constructor(private _userService: UserService) {
  this.user = new User();
  this.user.email = "user@nativescript.org";
  this.user.password = "password";
}
```

Full app.component.ts:

``` TypeScript
import {Component} from "angular2/core";
import {HTTP_PROVIDERS} from "angular2/http";
import {User} from "./shared/user/user";
import {UserService} from "./shared/user/user.service";

@Component({
  selector: "my-app",
  templateUrl: "pages/login/login.html",
  styleUrls: ["pages/login/login-common.css", "pages/login/login.css"],
  providers: [UserService, HTTP_PROVIDERS]
})
export class AppComponent {
  user: User;
  isLoggingIn = true;

  constructor(private _userService: UserService) {
    this.user = new User();
    this.user.email = "user@nativescript.org";
    this.user.password = "password";
  }
  submit() {
    if (this.isLoggingIn) {
      this.login();
    } else {
      this.signUp();
    }
  }
  login() {
    // TODO: Define
  }
  signUp() {
    this._userService.register(this.user)
      .subscribe(
        () => {
          alert("Your account was successfully created.");
          this.toggleDisplay();
        },
        () => alert("Unfortunately we were unable to create your account.")
      );
  }
  toggleDisplay() {
    this.isLoggingIn = !this.isLoggingIn;
  }
}
```

Copy app/app.component.ts into app/pages/login/login.component.ts, change the name of the class from ‚ÄúAppComponent‚Äù to ‚ÄúLoginPage, and update the two paths below accordingly:

``` TypeScript
import {User} from "../../shared/user/user";
import {UserService} from "../../shared/user/user.service";
```

Open app/app.component.ts back up and paste in the following code:

``` TypeScript
import {Component} from "angular2/core";
import {HTTP_PROVIDERS} from "angular2/http";
import {RouteConfig} from "angular2/router";
import {NS_ROUTER_DIRECTIVES, NS_ROUTER_PROVIDERS} from "nativescript-angular/router";
import {LoginPage} from "./pages/login/login.component";

@Component({

  providers: [NS_ROUTER_PROVIDERS],
  template: "<page-router-outlet></page-router-outlet>"
})
@RouteConfig([
  { path: "/Login", component: LoginPage, as: "Login", useAsDefault: true },
])
export class AppComponent {}
```

Explain what‚Äôs going on here.

<div class="exercise-end"></div>

Let‚Äôs actually log the user in then, shall we?

<h4 class="exercise-start">
    <b>Exercise</b>: ???
</h4>

Open pages/list/list.component.ts and paste in this:

``` TypeScript
import {Component} from "angular2/core";

@Component({
  selector: "list",
  templateUrl: "pages/list/list.html",
  styleUrls: ["pages/list/list-common.css", "pages/list/list.css"]
})
export class ListPage {}
```

Next, open pages/list/list.html and paste in this:

``` XML
<Label text="Hello world"></Label>
```

Now, go back to app/app.component.ts and paste in this at the top of the file:

``` TypeScript
import {ListPage} from "./pages/list/list.component";
```

And this in the `@RouteConfig`:

``` TypeScript
{ path: "/List", component: ListPage, as: "List" }
```

Now go to app/shared/user/user.service.ts and add this function:

``` TypeScript
login(user: User) {
  var headers = new Headers();
  headers.append("Content-Type", "application/json");

  return this._http.post(
    Config.apiUrl + "oauth/token",
    JSON.stringify({
      username: user.email,
      password: user.password,
      grant_type: "password"
    }),
    { headers: headers }
  )
  .map(response => response.json())
  .do(data => {
    Config.token = data.Result.access_token;
  })
  .catch(this.handleErrors);
}
```

Finally, go to `app/login/login.component.ts` and change the login function to do this:

``` TypeScript
this._userService.login(this.user)
  .subscribe(
    () => this._router.navigate(["List"]),
    (error) => alert("Unfortunately we could not find your account.")
  );
```

To make this work, in the same file, add this to the top:

``` TypeScript
import {Router} from "angular2/router";
```

And this to the constructor:

``` TypeScript
constructor(private _router: Router, private _userService: UserService) {
```
