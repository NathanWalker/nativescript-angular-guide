<p><a href="https://www.nativescript.org/">NativeScript</a> is a framework for building native iOS and Android apps using JavaScript and CSS. NativeScript renders UIs with the native platform’s rendering engine—no <a href="http://developer.telerik.com/featured/what-is-a-webview/">WebViews</a>—resulting in native-like performance and UX. NativeScript was created and is supported by <a href="http://www.telerik.com/">Telerik</a>.</p>
<p>Angular JS is one of the most popular open source JavaScript frameworks for application development. The latest version of Angular, <a href="https://angular.io/">Angular 2</a>, makes it possible to use Angular outside of a web browser. NativeScript extends the Angular 2 runtime, making it possible for you to build native iOS and Android applications using the same framework—and in some cases the same code—that you use to build Angular 2 web apps. Let’s look at how it all works by building an app.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>WARNING #1</strong>: Although NativeScript itself is a production-ready framework that drives <a href="https://www.nativescript.org/showcases">many apps in the app stores today</a>, NativeScript’s Angular integration is still in an alpha stage. If you run into issues when using the Angular integration, please report them on <a href="https://github.com/NativeScript/nativescript-angular">https://github.com/NativeScript/nativescript-angular</a>. If you’re looking for a guide on using the production-ready flavor of NativeScript head to the <a href="http://docs.nativescript.org/start/getting-started">official Getting Started Guide</a>.</p>
<p><strong>WARNING #2 🚧</strong>: This guide is being actively written. If you choose to go through this today you’ll certainly find grammatical errors and steps that just don’t work. If you find an error in the guide please report the problem at <a href="https://github.com/tjvantoll/nativescript-angular-guide">https://github.com/tjvantoll/nativescript-angular-guide</a>. Pull requests are also welcome 😀</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="what-you-re-building">What you&#39;re building</h3>
<p>This guide will walk you through building <a href="https://github.com/NativeScript/sample-Groceries">Groceries</a>, a groceries management app that does the following things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Connects to an existing RESTful service.</li>
<li>Provides user registration and login.</li>
<li>Lets authenticated users add and delete groceries from a list.</li>
<li>Runs cross-platform (iOS and Android).</li>
</ul>
<p>If you follow along to the end, here&#39;s what the finished app will look like on iOS:</p>
<p><img src="/images/chapter0/ios/1.png" alt="login">
<img src="/images/chapter0/ios/2.png" alt="register">
<img src="/images/chapter0/ios/3.png" alt="list"></p>
<p>And here&#39;s what the app will look like on Android:</p>
<p><img src="/images/chapter0/android/1.png" alt="">
<img src="/images/chapter0/android/2.png" alt="">
<img src="/images/chapter0/android/3.png" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>
<p>This guide assumes that you have some basic knowledge of JavaScript, CSS, and your development machine’s terminal. More specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>JavaScript</strong>: You should know basic JavaScript concepts, such as how functions, if statements, and loops work.</li>
<li><strong>CSS</strong>: You should know how to write simple CSS selectors, and know how to apply CSS rules as name/value pairs.</li>
<li><strong>The terminal</strong>: You should know how to open a terminal or command-line prompt on your development machine, how to change directories, and how to execute commands.</li>
</ul>
<p>This guide will <em>not</em>, however, assume you have any knowledge of Angular 2 or TypeScript. When background Angular 2 or TypeScript expertise will help you understand a concept, this guide will link you to the appropriate places in the <a href="https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/">Angular</a> or <a href="http://www.typescriptlang.org/Handbook">TypeScript</a> documentation.</p>
<p>With that out of the way, let’s get started!</p>

				<h2 id="getting-up-and-running">Getting up and running</h2>
<p>In this chapter you&#39;re going to start with the basics, including installing the NativeScript CLI, starting a new project, and getting your first app up and running.</p>
<h3 id="install-nativescript-and-configure-your-environment">Install NativeScript and configure your environment</h3>
<p>The NativeScript CLI has a few system requirements you must have in place before building NativeScript apps. As a first step, start by going through the instructions for your operating system:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://docs.nativescript.org/start/ns-setup-win">Windows</a></li>
<li><a href="http://docs.nativescript.org/start/ns-setup-os-x">OS X</a></li>
<li><a href="http://docs.nativescript.org/start/ns-setup-linux">Linux</a></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>TIP</strong>: If you&#39;re a bit overwhelmed by these requirements, or if you&#39;re looking for a way to build iOS apps on Windows, you might be interested in <a href="http://www.telerik.com/platform">using NativeScript in the Telerik Platform</a>. The Telerik Platform provides tooling for NativeScript apps, including the ability to perform iOS and Android builds in the cloud, which removes the need to complete these system requirements.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After completing the setup you should have two commands available from your terminal: <code>tns</code>—which is short for <b>T</b>elerik <b>N</b>ative<b>S</b>cript—and <code>nativescript</code>. The two commands are equivalent, so we&#39;ll stick with the shorter <code>tns</code>.</p>
<p>You can verify the installation was successful by running <code>tns</code> in your terminal. You should see something like this:</p>
<pre><code>$ tns
# NativeScript
┌─────────┬─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Usage   │ Synopsis                                                            │
│ General │ $ tns &lt;Command&gt; [Command Parameters] [--command &lt;Options&gt;]          │
│ Alias   │ $ nativescript &lt;Command&gt; [Command Parameters] [--command &lt;Options&gt;] │
└─────────┴─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
</code></pre><h3 id="start-your-app">Start your app</h3>
<p>With the NativeScript CLI installed, it&#39;s time to start building your app. Normally, you would <a href="https://github.com/NativeScript/NativeScript-cli#create-project">use the <code>tns create</code> command to create an empty NativeScript application</a>. For this guide however, we&#39;ve scaffolded out a boilerplate project to act as a starting point for <a href="https://github.com/NativeScript/sample-Groceries">Groceries</a>.</p>
<h4 class="exercise-start">
    <b>Exercise</b>: Get the Groceries starting point
</h4>

<p>Navigate to a folder where you want to keep your app code:</p>
<div class="no-copy-button"></div>

<pre><code>cd the-folder-you-want-groceries-to-be-in
</code></pre><p>Next, assuming you have <a href="http://www.git-scm.com/">git installed</a>, clone the Groceries repo from GitHub:</p>
<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/NativeScript/sample-Groceries.git
</code></pre><p>After that, change to the newly cloned repo&#39;s folder:</p>
<pre><code>cd sample-Groceries
</code></pre><p>Finally, switch to the “angular-start” branch for this guide&#39;s starting point:</p>
<pre><code>git checkout angular-start
</code></pre><blockquote>
<p><strong>TIP:</strong> The “angular-end” branch has the final state of this guide&#39;s tutorial. Feel free to <a href="https://github.com/NativeScript/sample-Groceries/tree/angular-end">refer to the branch on GitHub</a> if you get stuck.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="exercise-end"></div>

<h3 id="add-target-development-platforms">Add target development platforms</h3>
<p>Your app is now set up, but before you run it, you need to initialize a platform-specific native project for each platform you intend to target.</p>
<h4 class="exercise-start">
    <b>Exercise</b>: Add the iOS and Android platforms
</h4>

<p>If you&#39;re on a Mac, start by adding the iOS platform:</p>
<pre><code>tns platform add ios
</code></pre><p>Next, add the Android platform with the same <code>platform add</code> command:</p>
<pre><code>tns platform add android
</code></pre><div class="exercise-end"></div>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> You can add platforms only for SDKs that you already have installed on your development machine. If you get errors running <code>tns platform add</code>, refer back to the section on <a href="#install-nativescript-and-configure-your-environment">setting up your development environment</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <code>platform add</code> command adds a folder called <code>platforms</code> to your project, and copies all of the required native SDKs into this folder. When you build the application, the NativeScript CLI will copy your application code into the <code>platforms</code> folder so that a native binary can be created.</p>
<h3 id="running-your-app">Running your app</h3>
<p>With the platform initialization complete, you can run your app in an emulator or on devices.</p>
<h4 class="exercise-start">
    <b>Exercise</b>: Run your app
</h4>

<p>If you&#39;re on a Mac, start by running the app in an iOS simulator with the following command:</p>
<pre><code>tns run ios --emulator
</code></pre><p>If all went well, you should see something like this:</p>
<p><img src="/images/chapter1/ios/1.png" alt="iOS login"></p>
<p>Next, run your app on an Android emulator with the following command:</p>
<pre><code>tns run android --emulator
</code></pre><blockquote>
<p><strong>WARNING</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>You must have at least one Android AVD (Android Virtual Device) configured for this command to work. If you get an error, try <a href="http://developer.telerik.com/featured/using-android-emulator-hybrid-mobile-apps-telerik-appbuilder/#managing-avds">setting up an AVD</a> and then run the command again.</li>
<li>If you&#39;re using <a href="https://www.genymotion.com">Genymotion</a>, launch your Genymotion virtual device, and then run <code>tns run android</code>.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>If all went well, you should see your app running in an Android emulator:</p>
<p><img src="/images/chapter1/android/1.png" alt="Android login"></p>
<div class="exercise-end"></div>

<p>Here are a few other tips for running NativeScript apps.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>TIP</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>To run on a USB-connected Android or iOS device, use the same <code>run</code> command without the <code>--emulator</code> flag—i.e. <code>tns run android</code> and <code>tns run ios</code>.</li>
<li>The <code>tns device</code> command lists all USB-connected iOS devices, USB-connected Android devices, and Genymotion virtual devices that <code>tns run</code> can deploy to. Note that <code>tns device</code> does not list iOS simulators.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="development-workflow">Development workflow</h3>
<p>At this point, you have the NativeScript CLI downloaded and installed, as well as the iOS and Android dependencies that you need to run your app. Now you need a good workflow that lets you make changes and see results fast. For that we’ll use the <code>tns livesync</code> command.</p>
<h4 class="exercise-start">
    <b>Exercise</b>: Your first NativeScript change
</h4>

<p>If your previous <code>tns run ios</code> or <code>tns run android</code> task is still running, type <code>Ctrl+C</code> in your terminal to kill it.</p>
<p>If you’re on a Mac, start an iOS livesync watcher by executing the following command:</p>
<pre><code>tns livesync ios --emulator --watch
</code></pre><p>If you have an Android emulator running, start an Android livesync watcher by executing the following command:</p>
<pre><code>tns livesync android --watch
</code></pre><p>The <code>tns livesync</code> command updates your app by transferring the updated source code to the device or simulator. By adding the <code>--watch</code> flag, the <code>livesync</code> command additionally watches the files in your NativeScript project. Whenever one of those files changes, the command detects the update, and patches your app with the updated code.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>TIP</strong>: You can learn about how this is possible by reading more about <a href="http://developer.telerik.com/featured/nativescript-works/">how NativeScript works</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To see livesync in action let’s make a small update to your app. Open your project’s <code>app/app.component.ts</code> file in your text editor of choice and change <code>&lt;label text=&#39;hello world&#39;&gt;&lt;/label&gt;</code> to <code>&lt;label text=&#39;hello NativeScript&#39;&gt;&lt;/label&gt;</code>. Save the file and you should see the app relaunch and the updated text displayed.</p>
<div class="exercise-end"></div> 

<p>In addition to updating your NativeScript app on the fly, the livesync command also shows the output of <code>console.log()</code> statements as your app executes, as well as stack traces when things go wrong. So if your app crashes at any time during this guide, look to the terminal for a detailed report of the problem.</p>
<p>The iOS and Android logs can be a bit noisy, so you might have to scroll up a bit to find the actual problem. For example if I try to call <code>foo.bar()</code> when <code>foo</code> does not exist, here&#39;s the information I get on iOS:</p>
<pre><code>/app/path/to/file.js:14:8: JS ERROR ReferenceError: Can&#39;t find variable: foo
1   0xe3dc0 NativeScript::FFICallback&lt;NativeScript::ObjCMethodCallback&gt;::ffiClosureCallback(ffi_cif*, void*, void**, void*)
</code></pre><p>And here&#39;s the same information in the Android logs:</p>
<pre><code>E/TNS.Native( 2063): ReferenceError: foo is not defined
E/TNS.Native( 2063): File: &quot;/data/data/org.nativescript.groceries/files/app/./views/login/login.js, line: 13, column: 4
</code></pre><blockquote>
<p><strong>TIP</strong>: When you&#39;re trying to debug a problem, try adding <code>console.log()</code> statements in your JavaScript code—exactly as you would in a browser-based application.</p>
<p><strong>WARNING</strong>: Not all changes can be livesync’d in a NativeScript app. For instance, livesync cannot patch native configuration file changes (<code>Info.plist</code>, <code>AndroidManifest.xml</code>, and so forth), new plugin installations, and any other change that requires a full compilation of the application. In those cases, you’ll want to use <code>Ctrl+C</code> to stop livesync, and rerun the application using the <code>tns run ios</code> and <code>tns run android</code> commands. Not to worry though, when situations that require a full compilation come up in this guide, these instructions will be explicitly listed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now that you&#39;ve created an app, configured your environment, and set up your app to run on iOS and Android, you&#39;re ready to start digging into the files that make up a NativeScript app.</p>

			</div>
			<div class="chapter">
				<h2 id="building-the-ui">Building the UI</h2>
<p>Before you start coding the Groceries app it&#39;s important to understand a NativeScript app&#39;s folder structure. It&#39;ll help you understand where to place new files, as well as a bit of what&#39;s going on with NativeScript under the hood.</p>
<p>Go ahead and open your app&#39;s <code>sample-Groceries</code> folder in your text editor of choice and let&#39;s dig in.</p>
<h3 id="directory-structure">Directory structure</h3>
<p>To keep things simple, let&#39;s start by looking at the outer structure of the Groceries app:</p>
<pre><code>.
└── sample-Groceries
    ├── app
    │   └── ...
    ├── node_modules
    │   ├── angular2
    │   ├── nativescript-angular
    │   ├── tns-core-modules
    │   └── ...
    ├── platforms
    │   ├── android
    │   └── ios
    ├── package.json
    └── tsconfig.json
</code></pre><p>Here&#39;s what these various files and folders do:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>app</strong>: This folder contains all the development resources you need to build your app. You&#39;ll be spending most of your time editing the files in here.</li>
<li><strong>node_modules</strong>: This folder contains your app&#39;s npm module dependencies, including Angular 2, TypeScript, and the other modules NativeScript needs to build your app.</li>
<li><strong>node_modules/angular2</strong>: This folder contains the Angular 2 source code. NativeScript does not alter the core Angular 2 source code in any way, instead, NativeScript builds on top of Angular 2 with the nativescript-angular npm module.</li>
<li><strong>node_modules/nativescript-angular</strong>: This folder contains the module that integrates NativeScript-specific functionality into Angular 2. The source code for this module lives at <a href="https://github.com/NativeScript/nativescript-angular">https://github.com/NativeScript/nativescript-angular</a>.</li>
<li><strong>node_modules/tns-core-modules</strong>: This folder contains your app&#39;s NativeScript modules, which are a series of NativeScript-provided JavaScript modules you&#39;ll use to build your app. Each module contains the platform-specific code needed to implement some feature—the camera, http calls, the file system, and so forth—exposed through a platform-agnostic API (e.g. <code>camera.takePicture()</code>). We&#39;ll look at some examples in <a href="#chapter4">chapter 4</a>. The source code for these modules lives at <a href="https://github.com/NativeScript/nativescript">https://github.com/NativeScript/nativescript</a>.</li>
<li><strong>platforms</strong>: This folder contains the platform-specific code NativeScript needs to build native iOS and Android apps. For example in the <code>android</code> folder you&#39;ll find things like your project&#39;s <code>AndroidManifest.xml</code> and .apk executable files. Similarly, the <code>ios</code> folder contains the Groceries&#39; Xcode project and .ipa executables. Note, users on Windows machines will not have an <code>ios</code> folder.</li>
<li><strong>package.json</strong>: This file contains your app&#39;s configuration details, such as your app id, the version of NativeScript you&#39;re using, and also which npm modules your app uses. We&#39;ll take a closer look at how to use this file when we talk about using npm modules in <a href="#plugins-and-npm-modules">chapter 5</a>.</li>
<li><strong>tsconfig.json</strong>: This file contains your app’s TypeScript configuration. Unless you have existing TypeScript expertise, you’ll probably want to leave this file alone for now. If you do have existing experience you may want to tweak these values to suit your personal preferences, however, note that the <code>&quot;experimentalDecorators&quot;</code> and <code>&quot;emitDecoratorMetadata&quot;</code> flags are essential to making NativeScript and Angular 2 work, so don’t remove those. You can refer to the official TypeScript wiki for <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/tsconfig.json">detailed documentation on what you can do in a <code>tsconfig.json</code> file</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The NativeScript CLI manages the <code>platforms</code> folder for you as you develop and run your app; therefore, it&#39;s a best practice to treat the <code>platforms</code> folder as generated code. The Groceries app includes the <code>platforms</code> folder in its <a href="https://github.com/NativeScript/sample-Groceries/blob/master/.gitignore"><code>.gitignore</code></a> to exclude its files from source control.</p>
<p>Next, let&#39;s dig into the <code>app</code> folder, as that&#39;s where you&#39;ll be spending the majority of your time.</p>
<pre><code>.
└── sample-Groceries
    ├── app
    │   ├── App_Resources
    │   │   ├── Android
    │   │   └── iOS
    │   ├── pages
    │   │   ├── login.component.ts
    │   │   └── ...
    │   ├── shared
    │   │   └── ...
    │   ├── app.css
    │   ├── app.component.ts
    │   ├── main.ts
    │   └── ...
    └── ...
</code></pre><p>Here&#39;s what these various files and folders do:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>App_Resources</strong>: This folder contains platform-specific resources such as icons, splash screens, and configuration files. The NativeScript CLI takes care of injecting these resources into the appropriate places in the <code>platforms</code> folder when you execute <code>tns run</code>.</li>
<li><strong>pages</strong>: This folder, specific to the Groceries app, contains the code to build your app&#39;s pages. Each page is made up of a TypeScript file and an optional HTML file. The Groceries app starts with three TypeScript files for its three pages—a login page, a registration page, and a list page. In a more complex app you may wish to create a more detailed folder structure within <code>pages</code>, but for now, keeping all pages in the root simplifies our demo.</li>
<li><strong>shared</strong>: This folder, also specific to the Groceries app, contains any files you need to share across pages in your app. In the Groceries app, you&#39;ll find a few service classes for talking to backend services, a few model objects, and a <code>config.ts</code> file used to share configuration variables like API keys.</li>
<li><strong>app.css</strong>: This file contains global styles for your app. We&#39;ll dig into app styling in <a href="#css">section 2.3</a>.</li>
<li><strong>app.component.ts</strong>: This primary Angular component that drives your application. Eventually this file will handle routing and application-wide configuration, however for now the file has a simple hello world example that we’ll look at momentarily.</li>
<li><strong>main.ts</strong>: The starting point of Angular 2 applications—web and native.</li>
</ul>
<p>To get a sense of a NativeScript app actually starts up, let’s dig in to the first few files.</p>
<h3 id="starting-up">Starting up</h3>
<p>The first few files you run in a NativeScript app look almost identical to <a href="https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/quickstart.html">the first few files you run in an Angular 2 web app</a>. Let’s start with <code>main.ts</code> as that’s the first file executed. Open your <code>app.main.ts</code> file; you should see the code below:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-JavaScript">import {nativeScriptBootstrap} from &quot;nativescript-angular/application&quot;;
import {AppComponent} from &quot;./app.component&quot;;

nativeScriptBootstrap(AppComponent);
</code></pre>
<p>Here you’re using the TypeScript <code>import</code> command to bring in a function—<code>nativescriptBootstrap()</code>—and a <a href="http://www.typescriptlang.org/Handbook#classes">TypeScript class</a>—<code>AppComponent</code>—each of which are defined in separate files. The <code>nativescriptBootstrap()</code> function comes from the “nativescript-angular” npm module, which you may recall contains the code needed to integrate NativeScript and Angular 2. Whereas <a href="https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/api/platform/browser/bootstrap-function.html">Angular 2’s own <code>bootstrap()</code> function</a> starts an Angular 2 browser app, NativeScript’s bootstrap function starts an Angular 2 native app.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>TIP</strong>: If you’re curious about what <code>nativescriptBootstrap()</code> function actually has to do to startup native iOS and Android apps, remember that all this code is open source for you to explore at any time. The <code>nativescriptBootstrap()</code> function specifically is defined in an <a href="https://github.com/NativeScript/nativescript-angular/blob/master/src/nativescript-angular/application.ts"><code>application.ts</code> file</a> in the <a href="https://github.com/NativeScript/nativescript-angular">NativeScript/nativescript-angular repository</a> on GitHub.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The bootstrap function, regardless of whether it’s for the web or for native apps, needs to know which Angular component to start the application with. In this case, you’re passing to control to a <code>AppComponent</code> component defined in <code>app.component.ts</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>TIP</strong>: In NativeScript we follow Angular 2’s own convention of naming component files with a <code>.component.ts</code> suffix.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Next, open your app’s <code>app/app.component.ts</code> file; you should see the code below:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-JavaScript">// TODO: I can’t explain why this is necessary until I know why this is necessary
// import &quot;reflect-metadata&quot;;
import {Component} from &quot;angular2/core&quot;;

@Component({
  // TODO: Can I just remove this to simplify the explanation below? Is it really “my” app if I cloned the app from GitHub? WHAT DOES IT ALL MEAN?
  // selector: &quot;my-app&quot;,

  template: &quot;&lt;label text=&#39;hello NativeScript&#39;&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&quot;
})
export class AppComponent {}
</code></pre>
<p>This file contains an Angular 2 component, which is the primary building block you’ll use to build your NativeScript applications. Let’s break down what’s going on in this file.</p>
<p>First, you again use TypeScript’s <code>import</code> command to bring in externally defined functionality—in this case, the <code>Component</code> class from Angular 2 itself. In Angular 2 a component manages a view, or a piece of the user interface that the user sees. A component be used to define an individual UI element, or an entire page, and eventually we’ll add a bunch of logic to these components and use them to build an entire app. But for now this component is simple for the purpose of demonstration.</p>
<p>Notice the interesting way that the <code>Component</code> class is used—with the syntax <code>@Component</code>. This is a <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript-Handbook/blob/master/pages/Decorators.md">TypeScript decorator</a>, which allows you to annotate a TypeScript class or method with additional information. For now, you can think of it as a way of adding some metadata configuration to the currently empty <code>AppComponent</code> class. Specifically, the <code>@Component</code> decorator’s <code>template</code> property tells NativeScript how to render this component on the screen. In fact, the <code>&lt;label text=&quot;hello NativeScript&quot;&gt;&lt;/label&gt;</code> syntax is why you saw “hello NativeScript” when you ran this app earlier.</p>
<p>However, this syntax may look a bit odd if you come from a web development background. On the web, the <code>&lt;label&gt;</code> HTML element doesn’t have a <code>text</code> attribute, so what’s going on here. Let’s dive into this by looking at how NativeScript UI components work.</p>
